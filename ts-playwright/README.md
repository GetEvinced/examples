# Evinced JS/TS Playwright SDK

This repository demonstrates the use of the Evinced SDK with examples in both TypeScript and JavaScript. These examples showcase best practices for integrating the SDK and running accessibility tests efficiently, including support for CI/CD pipelines.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies 
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Ensure you add your `.npmrc` file and credentials
4. If everything installed, you are ready to run `npx playwright test`

## To note
The SDK makes use of all features that are available through the Evinced SDK, we have screenshots, test reports, hooks, use of each available method, and parallel testing. The typescript example also makes use of a cool aggregated reports feature with screenshots.
