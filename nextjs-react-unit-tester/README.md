## 100% Test Coverage Using All Methods

This repository ensures 100% test coverage using all available testing methods.

## Usage

To run the tests, use the following command:

```sh
npm test
```

To test a specific method, you can use the convention: `npm test <componentName>` - for example `npm test modal` or `npm test table`. This works for every method available on the SDK.

## Testing Framework

This repository utilizes [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) and Jest to test React-based components that follow best practices.
