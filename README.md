## To note:
- In each folder, the commands to use the repository are present in the `README.md` file and they vary slightly project by project, please take a moment to review
- In order for this to work properly, you must add a `.npmrc` file or provide the necessary authentication credentials related to your SDK. The keys can be obtained by logging into your Evinced account
- Please ensure you run `npm install` to set the project up
- You will see that in the tests we do use environment variables which are stored on our machines, you will need to either set the named variables on your machine or change accordingly to ensure you get up and running!

An example set of environment variables might look like this:
```javascript
configure({
  serviceAccountId: process.env.EVINCED_SERVICE_ID,
  serviceAccountSecret: process.env.EVINCED_API_KEY,
});
```
